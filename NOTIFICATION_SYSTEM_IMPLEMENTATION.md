# YouTube-Style Notification System Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive notification system similar to YouTube's that tracks likes, comments, and replies on both videos and posts. When users interact with content, the content authors receive detailed notifications with navigation links to the specific content.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Notification Model (`models/Notification.local.js`)
- Added support for `sender` field to track who triggered the notification
- Enhanced `relatedContent` object with detailed tracking:
  - `contentType`: 'video', 'post', 'comment', 'reply'
  - `contentId`: ID of the main content (video/post)
  - `commentId`: ID of the comment (if applicable)
  - `replyId`: ID of the reply (if applicable)
  - `parentReplyId`: ID of parent reply for nested replies
  - `link`: Direct navigation URL to the content
- Added 'reply' to notification types

### 2. Improved Notification Service (`services/notificationService.js`)
Enhanced the following functions:

#### `sendLikeNotification(recipientId, senderId, contentType, contentId, contentTitle, extraData)`
- Generates personalized messages like "John liked your video 'How to Code'"
- Creates proper navigation links based on content type
- Handles likes on videos, posts, comments, and replies
- Prevents self-notifications

#### `sendCommentNotification(recipientId, senderId, contentType, contentId, contentTitle, commentText, extraData)`
- Creates notifications for comments on videos and posts
- Includes comment ID for direct navigation
- Generates links like `/video/123?comment=456`

#### `sendReplyNotification(recipientId, senderId, contentType, contentId, contentTitle, replyText, extraData)`
- New function for reply notifications
- Handles both first-level and nested replies
- Creates links like `/video/123?comment=456&reply=789`
- Distinguishes between "replied to your comment" vs "replied to your reply"

### 3. Updated Controllers

#### Video Controller (`controllers/videoController.js`)
- **`likeVideo`**: Sends like notifications to video uploaders
- **`likeComment`**: Sends like notifications to comment authors with video context
- **`likeReply`**: Sends like notifications to reply authors with full context
- **`addComment`**: Sends comment notifications with comment ID for navigation
- **`replyComment`**: Sends reply notifications with proper reply/comment hierarchy

#### Post Controller (`controllers/postController.js`)
- **`likePost`**: Sends like notifications to post authors
- **`likeComment`**: Sends like notifications to comment authors with post context
- **`likeReply`**: Sends like notifications to reply authors with full context
- **`addComment`**: Sends comment notifications with comment ID
- **`addReply`**: Sends reply notifications with proper hierarchy tracking

### 4. Enhanced API Routes (`routes/notifications.js`)
- `GET /api/notifications/unread` - Get top 5 unread notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/all` - Get all notifications with pagination
- `GET /api/notifications/count` - Get unread notification count
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-read` - Mark specific notifications as read
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all notifications as read
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-unread` - Mark notifications as unread
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete specific notification

### 5. Test Routes (`routes/test-notifications.js`)
- `POST /api/test-notifications/test-like` - Test like notifications
- `POST /api/test-notifications/test-comment` - Test comment notifications
- `POST /api/test-notifications/test-reply` - Test reply notifications

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Updated Notifications Page (`pages/Notifications.jsx`)
- **Navigation**: `handleNotificationClick()` function navigates to specific content
- **URL Generation**: Creates proper URLs with query parameters for comments/replies
  - Videos: `/video/123?comment=456&reply=789`
  - Posts: `/post/123?comment=456&reply=789`
- **API Integration**: Updated to use correct endpoints
- **Mark as Read**: Automatically marks notifications as read when clicked

### 2. Enhanced Notification Modal (`components/NotificationModal.jsx`)
- **Click Navigation**: Added click handlers for notification items
- **Reply Support**: Added reply icon and styling
- **Callback Integration**: Supports `onMarkAsRead` callback for parent components

## Notification Examples

### Like Notifications
- **Video**: "John liked your video 'How to Build a React App'"
- **Comment**: "Sarah liked your comment on 'JavaScript Tutorial'"
- **Reply**: "Mike liked your reply on 'React vs Vue'"

### Comment Notifications
- **Video**: "Alice commented on your video 'Python Basics'"
- **Post**: "Bob commented on your post"

### Reply Notifications
- **Comment**: "Emma replied to your comment on 'Node.js Guide'"
- **Reply**: "David replied to your reply on 'CSS Tips'"

## Navigation Behavior

When users click on notifications:
1. **Automatically marks as read** if unread
2. **Navigates to content** with proper URL parameters
3. **Scrolls to specific comment/reply** (requires frontend implementation)
4. **Highlights the interaction** for better UX

## Key Features

### 1. Prevention of Self-Notifications
- Users don't receive notifications for their own actions
- Prevents notification spam

### 2. Hierarchical Reply Support
- Tracks parent-child relationships in replies
- Supports nested reply notifications
- Proper navigation to specific reply threads

### 3. Content Context
- Notifications include content titles for clarity
- Shows interaction type (like, comment, reply)
- Includes sender information with avatars

### 4. Proper Cleanup
- Notifications auto-expire after 7-30 days
- Soft delete with cleanup service
- Pagination for better performance

## Usage Examples

### Testing the System
1. **Create test notifications**:
   ```javascript
   POST /api/test-notifications/test-like
   {
     "recipientId": "user123",
     "contentType": "video",
     "contentId": "video456",
     "contentTitle": "My Amazing Video"
   }
   ```

2. **Like a video**: API automatically creates notification
3. **Comment on video**: API creates comment notification with comment ID
4. **Reply to comment**: API creates reply notification with full hierarchy

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Fetch notifications
const notifications = await fetch('/api/notifications/all?page=1&limit=20');

// Mark as read when clicked
const handleClick = (notification) => {
  markAsRead(notification._id);
  navigate(notification.relatedContent.link);
};
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time notifications** with WebSockets
2. **Email/push notifications** for important interactions
3. **Notification preferences** per user
4. **Batch notifications** for multiple likes
5. **Notification grouping** ("John and 5 others liked your video")

The system is now fully functional and provides a YouTube-like notification experience with proper navigation, context, and user feedback!
